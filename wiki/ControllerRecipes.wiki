==== What do I do if my framework does not give me access to the servlet request and response objects in the Controller? ====

In my opinion, frameworks that do not offer a way to reach the request and response objects are taking things too far. At a minimum they should offer a way to let other frameworks still get at those objects. What I did was create a servlet filter to set the request and response in a thread local object. 

First setup the filter:
{{{
<filter>
    <filter-name>TableFacadeFilter</filter-name>
    <filter-class>org.jmesa.facade.filter.TableFacadeFilter</
filter-class>
</filter>
<filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>TableFacadeFilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/*</url-pattern>
</filter-mapping> 
}}}

Then use a static import to get at the request and response:

{{{
import static org.jmesa.facade.filter.TableFacadeFilter.FilterThreadLocal.getHttpServletRequest;
import static org.jmesa.facade.filter.TableFacadeFilter.FilterThreadLocal.getHttpServletResponse;
...

TableFacade tableFacade = TableFacadeFactory.createTableFacade(id, getHttpServletRequest());
tableFacade.setExportTypes(getHttpServletResponse(), CSV, JEXCEL, PDF);
...
}}}
