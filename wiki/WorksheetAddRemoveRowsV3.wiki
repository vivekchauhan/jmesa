Lets start with a visual! What we have here is a worksheet that has most of the new features applied. The row above the gray line is new. The second row in the body is being deleted. And the forth row is showing us the validation in action.

<img src="http://jmesa.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/jmesa/resources/wiki/worksheet.png" />

=== Worksheet Example ===

The following code is based on the worksheet [http://code.google.com/p/jmesa/source/browse/trunk/jmesaWeb/src/org/jmesaweb/controller/WorksheetPresidentController.java controller] in the examples war file. You should take a look at that to see how these code snippets fit in the overall template. If you need more information about working with the worksheet you should look at the [WorksheetTutorialV3 tutorial].

=== Adding Rows ===

The only thing you need to do to turn on the add worksheet row feature is enable the button on the toolbar via the [Preferences preferences]. Then by using the !TableModel you automatically gain support for adding rows to the worksheet. To save a row that was added refer to the section (below) on saving the worksheet.

{{{
html.toolbar.addWorksheetRow.enabled=true
}}}

If you have a custom toolbar you will need to add the new proper toolbar type.

{{{
addToolbarItem(ToolbarItemType.ADD_WORKSHEET_ROW_ITEM);
}}}

=== Removing Rows ===

To enable the feature of removing a row from the worksheet involves using a special worksheet editor. To save a row that was removed refer to the section (below) on saving the worksheet.

In this example we declared a made up column called "remove" and added it as the first column. _In general if you declare a column that does not exist JMesa will assume that this is a custom column._

_Note: by default the !RemoveRowWorksheetEditor will allow you to remove any row in the  worksheet. If you only want to remove rows that were added you can use the !RemoveRowAddedWorksheetEditor instead._

==== API ====

{{{
HtmlColumn remove = htmlRow.getColumn("remove");
remove.getCellRenderer().setWorksheetEditor(new RemoveRowWorksheetEditor());
remove.setTitle("&nbsp;");
remove.setFilterable(false);
remove.setSortable(false);
}}}

==== JSP Tag ====

{{{
<jmesa:htmlColumn property="remove" title="&nbsp;" filterable=" false" sortable="true" worksheetEditor="org.jmesa.worksheet.editor.RemoveRowWorksheetEditor"/>
}}}

=== Saving Worksheet ===

For more information about saving the worksheet refer to the worksheet [WorksheetTutorialV3 tutorial]. What I wanted to show you here is the !WorksheetRowStatus enum values.

{{{
worksheet.processRows(new WorksheetCallbackHandler() {
   public void process(WorksheetRow worksheetRow) {
      if (worksheetRow.getRowStatus().equals(WorksheetRowStatus.ADD)) {
         // would save the new President here
      } else if (worksheetRow.getRowStatus().equals(WorksheetRowStatus.REMOVE)) {
         // would delete the President here
      } else if (worksheetRow.getRowStatus().equals(WorksheetRowStatus.MODIFY)) {
         // would update the President here
      }
   }
});
}}}

=== Validation ===

For some time JMesa's worksheet has had server side validation upon saving changes. What this allow you to do is attach errors to the worksheet column. You can see this in the [WorksheetTutorialV3 worksheet tutorial] and looks like the following:

{{{
private void validateColumn(WorksheetColumn worksheetColumn, String changedValue) {
    if (changedValue.equals("foo")) {
        worksheetColumn.setErrorKey("foo.error");
    } else {
        worksheetColumn.removeError(); // remove previous errors
    }
}
}}}


But now we also have a new validation framework, based on the [http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/ bassistance] jQuery plugin. This will not only validate on the client, but will also update the worksheet column so that you can check to see if there are errors on the server side code when pressing save.

_Note: if you need to do both client side and serverside validation you can still set the error directly on the column manually._

The bassistance plugin is seamlessly integrated into the JMesa framework. All you need to do to use default validation is add the validation to the column. You can add as many validations to the column as you want. 

_Do not forget to add the bassistance !JavaScript to your project as well!_

==== API ====
{{{
HtmlColumn firstName = htmlRow.getColumn("name.firstName");
firstName.setTitle("First Name");
firstName.addWorksheetValidation(new WorksheetValidation(WorksheetValidationType.REQUIRED, WorksheetValidation.TRUE));
}}}

You can also add an error message like so.

{{{
new WorksheetValidation(WorksheetValidationType.REQUIRED, WorksheetValidation.TRUE).setErrorMessage("The first name is required.");
// OR
new WorksheetValidation(WorksheetValidationType.REQUIRED, WorksheetValidation.TRUE).setErrorMessageKey("message.firstName.required");
}}}


==== Tag ===

For the tag you need to separate the validation name and value with a colon. If you have multiple validations you need to separate the name/value pairs with a semi-colon.

{{{
<jmesa:htmlColumn property="name.firstName" title="First Name" worksheetValidation="required:true"/>
}}}

You can also add an error message by separating the validation name and message with a colon. If you have multiple validations you need to separate the name/message pairs with a semi-colon.

{{{
<jmesa:htmlColumn property="name.firstName" title="First Name" worksheetValidation="required:true" errorMessage="required:The first name is required" />
<!-- OR -->
<jmesa:htmlColumn property="name.firstName" title="First Name" worksheetValidation="required:true" errorMessageKey="required:message.firstName.required" />
}}}

==== Validation Methods ====

All the normal [http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation validation methods] are supported. As a convenience I am listing the types here. For more information about what each one is and how to use it you need to read the jQuery [http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation docs].

{{{
public class WorksheetValidationType {
    public static final String REQUIRED = "required";
    public static final String EMAIL = "email";
    public static final String URL = "url";
    public static final String DATE = "date";
    public static final String DATE_ISO = "dateISO";
    public static final String NUMBER = "number";
    public static final String DIGITS = "digits";
    public static final String CREDIT_CARD = "creditcard";
    public static final String ACCEPT = "accept";
    public static final String MAX_LENGTH = "maxlength";
    public static final String MIN_LENGTH = "minlength";
    public static final String RANGE_LENGTH = "rangelength";
    public static final String RANGE = "range";
    public static final String MAX_VALUE = "max";
    public static final String MIN_VALUE = "min";
}
}}}

==== Custom Validation ====
Apart from inbuilt validations, you can also provide a javascript function as validation. For that define a javascript function which returns true / false (valid / invalid). The value of column will be passed to the function.

{{{
function validateFirstName(firstName) {
	if (firstName == 'foo') {
		return false;
	}
	return true;
}
}}}

==== API ====

{{{
HtmlColumn firstName = htmlRow.getColumn("name.firstName");
firstName.setTitle("First Name");
firstName.addCustomWorksheetValidation(new WorksheetValidation("validateFirstName", "validateFirstName").setErrorMessage("You cannot use foo as a value"));
}}}

==== Tag ====
{{{
<jmesa:htmlColumn property="name.firstName" title="First Name" customWorksheetValidation="validateFirstName:validateFirstName" errorMessage="validateFirstName:You cannot use foo as a value" />
}}}


==== Debugging Validation ====

The validation is new so there is a chance you might have to look under the covers to see what the generated !JavaScript looks like when the page loads. So if you are having problems you should first do a view source on the page. Then look for something that looks like the following code. The generated code should be valid validation code as required by the bassistance plugin. If it is not you should submit a bug report so that we can take care of it.

{{{
jQuery.jmesa.setValidator('worksheet', $(jQuery.jmesa.getFormByTableId('worksheet')).validate({
	rules: {
		'name.firstName' : { required: true }
	},
	showErrors: function(errorMap, errorList) {
		jQuery.jmesa.setError('worksheet', errorMap);
	},
	onsubmit: false,
	onfocusout: false,
	onkeyup: false,
	onclick: false
}));
// Following will be generated only if custom validation is used
jQuery.validator.addMethod('validateFirstName', validateFirstName);
}}}

=== Worksheet Flow Diagram ===
Here is a basic flow diagram depicting how the changes made in worksheet are saved in session.

_If you do not have it already you should get the [http://getfirebug.com/ firebug] plugin installed to help you track down any errors. In general you should get firebug as it makes web development so much easier._
